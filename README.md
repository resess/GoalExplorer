# GoalExplorer

This repository hosts GoalExplorer which automatically triggers the functionality of interest in an apk. 
The core idea behind GoalExplorer is to first statically model the application UI screens and transitions between these screens, producing a Screen Transition Graph (STG). 
Then GoalExplorer uses the STG to guide the dynamic exploration of the application to the particular target of interest: an Android activity, API call, or a program statement.

The repository contains the source code for the application to produce STGs for android applications along with the tool 
used to dynamically explore to find the target of interest. 

### Compatibility
Currently, the tool supports API levels 25 and under. The Android Applications should also not use androidx libraries, due to a dependency on Backstage which fails to analyze components of these applications.

## Building The Tool
To build an STG, the application uses modified versions of [Backstage](https://github.com/uds-se/backstage) and 
[FlowDroid](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/FlowDroid). 
The modified version are provided in the respective `Backstage/` and `FlowDroid/` directories. 
You need to first build these modules before building GoalExplorer. 

### Example Commands
```
# Build Backstage
cd Backstage/
mvn -DskipTests clean install 
cd .. 

# Build FlowDroid
cd FlowDroid/
mvn -DskipTests clean install
cd .. 

# Build GoalExplorer 
cd GoalExplorer/ 
mvn -DskipTests clean package
```

## Using the Static Analyzer (STG Builder)
To build a STG, run the generated `.jar` which should be located under
`GoalExplorer/target/`. The jar should be run from the `GoalExplorer` directory.

### Command
```
java -jar target/GoalExplorer-1.2-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar ge -i <path to apk> [OPTIONS]
```
### Marking targets
By default, there will be no node marked as a target in the STG. To mark a target in the STG, 
add the option `--target "X:Y"` where `X` is one of `api`, `act` or `stmt` and `Y` is a fully qualified target or a list of targets separated by a semi-colon.

For example, if the target is an API:

```
    java -jar {JAR_PATH} ge -i <arg> [OPTIONS] --target "api:<java.net.URL: java.net.URLConnection openConnection()>" 
```
or for multiple activities:
```
    java -jar {JAR_PATH} ge -i <arg> [OPTIONS] --target "act:com.example.app.MainActivity;com.example.app.SettingsActivity"
```
or a Jimple statement:
```    
    java -jar {JAR_PATH} ge -i <arg> [OPTIONS] --target "stmt:virtualinvoke $r7.<android.widget.Button: void setOnClickListener(android.view.View$OnClickListener)>($r9)"
```
### Options
```
  usage: ge [OPTIONS] [-cb <arg>] [-cg <arg>] [-d] [-h] -i <arg> 
            [-l <arg>] [-o <arg>] [-s <arg>] [-t <arg>] [-v]
   -cb <arg>           the maximum number of callbacks modeled for each
                       component (default to 20)
   -d,--debug          debug mode (default disabled)
   -h,--help           print the help message
   -i,--input <arg>    input apk path (required)
   -l,--api <arg>      api level (default to 23)
   -o,--output <arg>   output directory (default to "sootOutput")
   -s,--sdk <arg>      path to android sdk (default value can be set in
                       config file)
   -t <arg>            maximum timeout during callback analysis in seconds
                       (default: 60)
   --target            target or list of targets of type api, stmt or act 
                       (e.g. "act:com.e.b.Activity1")
   -v,--version        print version info
```

An STG for the android application will be generated in the output directory. 

## Using the Dynamic Explorer 
The dynamic explorer is a modified version of [Stoat](https://github.com/tingsu/Stoat).
The modified source code is located in `Stoat/`

### Setup 
To run the dynamic exploration step:

```
ruby Stoat/bin/run_stoat_testing.rb \
    --avd_name={emulator name} \
    --apk_path={path to apk}
    --stg={path to apk stg}
```
